# Truss Analysis Using Method of Joints - UMass Amherst, CE-ENGIN 240, Egemen Okte

Please run Truss_Solver.mlx (live script) in MATLAB to view the two examples of trusses and their solutions. There are other functions such as arrow, solvetruss and plottruss that should be in the same folder for this script to run. You can always go into these functions to see how calculations are being made in the background.

This tool is coded in MATLAB to be consistent with the UMass Amherst CEE curriculum. It is for educational purposes only and may contain errors.
